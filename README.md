## General info
In recent decades, gradual decrease of the Atlantic Herring's size was noticed. In order to perform an appropriate analysis, one carried out measurements of herrings' lenght and their life conditions in last 60 years. As part of a single fishing, 50 to 100 three-year-old herrings were randomly selected.

## Technology
R 3.6 (i.a. dplyr, ggplot2, caret)

## Setup
Clone the repository and run the main.R script, by executing `Rscript main.R`

There is also a file with a report `Report.Rmd` which presents all the code and results in a concise way.

## Features
* Dealing with lacking data
* Basic statistics of data
* Detailed analysis of attributes' values
* Correlation analysis
* An animation presenting herrings' length change in time
* The prediction of herrings' size
* Analysis of attributes' importance
* The results are reproducible. 

To-do list:
* Experiment with other regressor models (and their find the best parameters)

## Status
Project is still in progress.
