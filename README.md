## General info

## Technologies
* R 3.6 (i.a. dplyr, ggplot2, caret)
* Tensorflow 2.0
* spaCy 2.2

## Setup
Clone the repository and:
* Open the jupyter notebook locally, by executing `jupyter notebook Solution.ipynb`

There is also a file with a report `Report.Rmd` which presents all the code and results in a concise way.

## Features
* Dealing with lacking data
* Basic statistics of data
* Detailed analysis of attributes' values
* Correlation analysis
* An animation presenting herrings' length change in time
* The prediction of herrings' size
* Analysis of attributes' importance
* The results are reproducible. 

To-do list:
* Experiment with other regressor models (and their find the best parameters)

## Status
Project is still in progress.
